When running docker under Linux, files created on a mounted volume from within the container are owned by root.
Instead, the owner should be mapped to the current user (which seems to happen automatically on OS X).

To fix this, follow the instructions in the link below and create the file /etc/docker/daemon.json with:

{
  "userns-remap": "default"
}

You will need to purge docker containers and restart docker for this to take effect.
